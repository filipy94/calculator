# Calculator :symbols:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Front End Certification.
It was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Functionality :white_check_mark:

-  At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display.

- As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display.

- In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.

- When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.

- I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.

- If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 * (-5)).
